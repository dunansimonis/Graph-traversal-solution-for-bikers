# Route Cycling project (BFS Search)

This code is part of a project I made at CentraleSupelec (Universit√© Paris Saclay) in 2022.
The project aimed at bulding our own shortest path solution for bikers.

The map are scrapped online on .osm format and then transformed into a json using the file: 

The notebook main.ipynb then provide a quick overview of how to solve *Shortest Path Problem* using Dijkstra and A Star algorithms and then adjust the solution to cycling isssues. The solution provided is then displayed on a image. We also highlight the interest of A star algorithm which will not visit all nodes in the graph and can therefore potentially be faster than Dijkstra Algorithm.

I do not present in this gitlab all the project and analysis than have been made. This is a quick overview of some coding I had made in this project. One can just read and follow the main notebook.
